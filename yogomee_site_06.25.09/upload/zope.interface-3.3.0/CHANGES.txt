zope.interface Package Changes
******************************

===========================================
zope.interface version 3.3.0b1 (2007/01/03)
===========================================

New Features
============

- The adapter-lookup algorithim was refactored to make it
  much simpler and faster.  

  Also, more of the adapter-lookup logic is implemented in C, making
  debugging of application code easier, since there is less
  infrastructre code to step through.

- We now treat objects without interafce declarations as if they
  declared that they provide zope.interface.Interface.

- There are a number of richer new adapter-registration interfaces
  that provide greater control and introspection.

- Added a new interface decorator to zope.interface that allows the
  setting of tagged values on an interface at definition time (see
  zope.interface.taggedValue).

Bug Fixes
=========

- A bug in multi-adapter lookup sometimes caused incorrect adapters to
  be returned.
