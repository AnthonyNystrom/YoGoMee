Description: This module provides a nearly complete wrapping
        of the Oracle/Sleepycat C API for the Database
        Environment, Database, Cursor, and Transaction
        objects, and each of these is exposed as a Python
        type in the bsddb3.db module.  The databse objects
        can use various access methods: btree, hash, recno,
        and queue.  Please see the documents in the docs
        directory of the source distribution or at the
        website for more details on the types and methods
        provided.  The goal is the mirror most of the real
        BerkeleyDB API so fall back to the Oracle BerkeleyDB
        documentation as appropriate.  Not everything API
        supported has been documented in the included docs.
