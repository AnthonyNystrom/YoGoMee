<h1 align=center>What can you do with Berkeley DB?</h1>
<p>Berkeley DB was designed to provide industrial-strength database services to
application developers, without requiring them to become database experts.
It is a classic C library style <i>toolkit</i>, providing a broad base
of functionality to application writers.  Berkeley DB was written by
programmers, for programmers:  its modular design surfaces simple,
orthogonal interfaces to core services, and it provides mechanism (for
example, good thread support) without imposing policy (for example, the
use of threads is not required).  Just as importantly, Berkeley DB allows
developers to balance performance against the need for crash recovery and
concurrent use.  An application can use the storage structure that
provides the fastest access to its data and can request only the degree
of logging and locking that it needs.
<p>Berkeley DB is powerful enough to use as the underlying support for large
network servers and simple enough to use in a fast prototype for a
single-user application.  There are many large, complex, multi-threaded
servers running on fast, multi-processor machines, depending on Berkeley DB
transaction semantics for recovery after system or application failure.
<p>Most Berkeley DB applications fall into two categories: basic data management
and data management with recovery.  In basic data management, applications
use the Berkeley DB access methods to manage their data without concern for
application or system failure.  The only Berkeley DB interfaces necessary for
this purpose are the <i>Access Method</i> and <i>Cursor</i>
interfaces. In data management with recovery, applications add calls to
the transaction subsystem in order to ensure complete recoverability in
the face of application or system failure.
<p>Generally, both of these categories involve linking Berkeley DB into the
process' address space.  It is also possible to build client-server
systems using Berkeley DB.  In such cases, application writers use Berkeley DB to
implement the server as described above, and then select an inter-process
communication (IPC) mechanism which the client will use to talk to the
server.  The Berkeley DB distribution does not include an IPC mechanism, and it
is up to the application writer to implement this functionality.
<p>While the primary purpose of Berkeley DB is to provide a complete database
environment to applications, it is important to realize that Berkeley DB
includes general-purpose shared memory buffer-pool and general-purpose
lock manager interfaces, among others.  These interfaces are directly
useful to application writers that may have no interest in databases.
<p>Additionally, because of the tool-based approach and separate interfaces
for each subsystem, you can support a complete transaction environment
for other system operations, e.g., Berkeley DB allows you to wrap transactions
around the standard UNIX read/write operations!  Further, Berkeley DB was
designed to interact correctly with the UNIX toolset, a feature no other
database package offers.  For example, Berkeley DB supports "hot backups"
(database backups while the database is in use), and you can use the
standard UNIX tools to do those backups, e.g., <b>dump</b>(1),
<b>tar</b>(1), <b>cpio</b>(1), <b>pax</b>(1) or even
<b>cp</b>(1).
<p>Finally, because scripting language interfaces are available for Berkeley DB
(notably Tcl and Perl), application writers can build incredibly powerful
database engines with little effort.  You can build transaction-protected
database applications using your favorite scripting languages, an
increasingly important feature in a world using CGI scripts to deliver
HTML.
