<h1 align=center>Recovery procedures</h1>
<p>The fifth component of the infrastructure, recovery procedures, concerns
the recoverability of the database.  After any application or system
failure, there are two possible approaches to database recovery:
<p><ol>
<p><li>There is no need for recoverability, and all databases can be re-created
from scratch.  Although these applications may still need transaction
protection for other reasons, recovery usually consists of removing the
Berkeley DB environment home directory and all files it contains, and then
restarting the application.
<p><li>It is necessary to recover information after system or application
failure.  In this case, recovery processing must be performed on any
database environments that were active at the time of the failure.
Recovery processing involves running the <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> utility or
calling the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DB_ENV-&gt;open</a> function with the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_RECOVER">DB_RECOVER</a> or
<a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_RECOVER_FATAL">DB_RECOVER_FATAL</a> flags.
<p>During recovery processing, all database changes made by aborted or
unfinished transactions are undone, and all database changes made by
committed transactions are redone, as necessary.  Database applications
must not be restarted until recovery completes.  After recovery
finishes, the environment is properly initialized so that applications
may be restarted.
</ol>
<p>If you intend to do recovery, there are two possible types of recovery
processing:
<p><ol>
<p><li><i>catastrophic recovery</i>.  A failure that requires catastrophic
recovery is a failure where either the database or log files are
destroyed or corrupted.  For example, catastrophic failure includes the
case where the disk drive on which either the database or logs are
stored has been physically destroyed, or when the system's normal
filesystem recovery on startup cannot bring the database and log files
to a consistent state.  This is often difficult to detect, and is
perhaps the most common sign of the need for catastrophic recovery is
when the normal recovery procedures fail.
<p>To restore your database environment after catastrophic failure, take
the following steps:
<p><ol>
<p><li>Restore the most recent snapshots of the database and log files from
the backup media into the system directory where recovery will be
performed.
<p><li>If any log files were archived since the last snapshot was made, they
should be restored into the Berkeley DB environment directory where recovery
will be performed.  Make sure that you restore them in the order in
which they were written.  The order is important because it's possible
that the same log file appears on multiple backups, and you want to run
recovery using the most recent version of each log file.
<p><li>Run the <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> utility, specifying its <b>-c</b> option;
or call the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DB_ENV-&gt;open</a> function, specifying the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_RECOVER_FATAL">DB_RECOVER_FATAL</a>
flag.  The catastrophic recovery process will review the logs and
database files to bring the environment databases to a consistent state
as of the time of the last uncorrupted log file that is found.  It is
important to realize that only transactions committed before that date
will appear in the databases.
<p>It is possible to re-create the database in a location different from
the original by specifying appropriate pathnames to the <b>-h</b>
option of the <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> utility. In order for this to work
properly, it is important that your application refer to files by names
relative to the database home directory or the pathname(s) specified in
calls to <a href="../../api_c/env_set_data_dir.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_data_dir</a>, instead of using full
pathnames.
</ol>
<p><li><i>non-catastrophic</i> or <i>normal recovery</i>.  If the
failure is non-catastrophic and the database files and log are both
accessible on a stable filesystem, run the <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> utility
without the <b>-c</b> option or call the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DB_ENV-&gt;open</a> function
specifying the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_RECOVER">DB_RECOVER</a> flag.  The normal recovery process
will review the logs and database files to ensure that all changes
associated with committed transactions appear in the databases, and that
all uncommitted transactions do not appear.
</ol>
